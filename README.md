# Features

### Log Individual Seizures

People with epilepsy typically need to log their seizures for their doctors. With SeizureTracker, this is as simple as
logging in, clicking on "Log Seizure", and entering any information you or another person can remember. These logs can be
filtered in-depth and exported by in a standard format for consumption by other tools such as Microsoft Excel.

### Medication Management
Some people with epilepsy suffer from memory issues, which makes managing complex medications difficult. With SeizureTracker,
click on "Medications" to see a breakdown of all your recorded medications.

# Philosophy
This tool is designed to be 100% free/libre open source, and will forever remain as such. I **do not** intend to make
profits on it and that will never change. Those who have epilepsy already have enough screwing over for one lifetime thanks
to the medical system.

This tool is also designed to be self-hosted to further maintain transparency. There may be a managed version in the future,
that will once again remain non-profit and a base version I would love to keep free/very cheap (enough to pay for server costs and any HIPAA stuff).

# Installation
SeizureTracker is very trivial to set up your own self-hosted instance. First, you'll need a computer of some sort with
Docker installed. TODO finish

# Contribution
Please contribute! This tool is licensed under GPLv3, and I welcome any and all contributions!
